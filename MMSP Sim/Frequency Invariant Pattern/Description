This folder contains the simulation files to simulate the impulse response captured by an open spherical microphone array (SMA).

The open SMA and the source are in a shoebox room. 
The source has frequency invariant directivity pattern, which was also the case in the SMIR generator from https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/habets/software/smir-generator .
