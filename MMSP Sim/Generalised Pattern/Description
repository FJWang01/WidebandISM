This folder contains the simulation programme that simulates the impulse responses captured by an open spherical microphone array.

The loudspeaker and the open SMA are in a shoebox room. The simulation programme can integrate loudspeaker directional impulse responses from the DirPat dataset. 

In the simulation programme, the loudspeaker is Genelec-8020. 

Details of the DirPat dataset can be accessed from https://opendata.iem.at/projects/dirpat . Measurement details are in the following publication:
