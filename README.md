## Note 1
Programmes within the "MMSP Sim/Frequency Invariant Pattern" folder utilise the SMIR Generator from https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/habets/software/smir-generator . Details of the SMIR generator can be found here:

D. P. Jarrett, E. A. P. Habets, M. R. P. Thomas and P. A. Naylor, "Rigid sphere room impulse response simulation: algorithm and applications," Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Volume 132, Issue 3, pp. 1462-1472, 2012.

## Note 2
Programmes within the "MMSP Sim/Generalised Pattern" utilise the loudspeaker directional impulse responses (DIRs) of Genelec 8020. The DIRs are extracted from the DirPat dataset. 

Details of the DirPat dataset can be accessed from https://opendata.iem.at/projects/dirpat . Measurement details are in the following publication:

M. Brandner, M. Frank, and D. Rudrich, “DirPat—Database and viewer of 2D/3D directivity patterns of sound sources and receivers,” Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 2018.
